**Welcome!** I'm a full-stack Software Engineer originally from Bolivia 🇧🇴 enjoying life in Vancouver, Canada 🇨🇦 
My day work is as a full stack engineer at Microsoft. 

During my free time I'm attempting to learn Flutter/Dart, enjoy an outdoor sport, or brew a new beer/wine.

Expect tech related posts and maybe some random thought I find worth while sharing in this blog 🤙🏼

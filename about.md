**Welcome!** I'm a Software Engineer orignally from Bolivia 🇧🇴 enjoying life in Vancouver, Canada 🇨🇦 
My day work is as a full stack engineer at Microsoft. I've done a little bit of everything:
- Data processing (Scala, Pyspark, U-SQL)
- Infrastructure in Azure/Azure Devops/.NET
- Backend (.NET/C#)
- Frontend (React)

During my free time I'm attempting now to learn Flutter/Dart among other stuff.

Expect tech related posts and maybe some random thought I find worth while in this blog 🤙🏼
